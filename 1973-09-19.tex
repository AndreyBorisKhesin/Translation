\begin{enumerate}
\item
The report was largely dedicated to the overview of the result of papers
[1]$-$[5].
Two theorems that were not included in these papers are described below.
\item
Theorem 1.
(O. V. Ljashko).
\textit{The space of complex Morse functions contains a local homotopic type of
$K(\pi,1)$ space in the neighbourhood of the functions $A_\mu$, $D_\mu$, and
$E_\mu$ (see [2]).
For this $\pi$, the subgroup of finite index $\nu$ is in the Artin braid group
with $\mu$ threads.
Here $\nu=\mu!h^\mu/|W|$, where $h$ is Kokster's value and $|W|$ is the order of
Weil's group.
Thus, $\nu$ has the following values:}

\d

The space that theorem 1 refers to, $K(\pi,1)$, can be described as follows.
Let $f(x),x\in\mathbb{C}^n$ be a uniformly-weighted polynomial with a critical
point at $x=0$ of type $A_\mu$, $D_\mu$, or $E_\mu$.
Let \d be a $\mu$-parametric versal deformationof the function $f$, where \d is
the parameter and $e_s(x)$, the terms.

Let $G$ be the set of all values of $\lambda\in\mathbb{C}^\mu$, for which \d
has no multiple critical points and no mutiple critical values.
$G$ is thus the space $K(\pi,1)$.
\item
Theorem 2.
\textit{Any two-variable holomorphic function with an isolated critical point at
0 with a 3-jet $x^3$ becomes biholomorphic near the point at 0 by coordinate
substitution with one of the normal forms of the following list:}

\d

\textit{Here letters represent the following functions of $x$ and $y$:}

\d

\textit{where \d.}

The modality of the sprouts of all the indicated functions at 0 is equal to
$k-1$, while the multiple (Milnor's value) is given by \d.
\item
I am using the opportuinity to point out several typos in [1]$-$[4].
In [2] on page 13 on lines 24 and 26, and on page 14 on line 27, instead of
$x_1x^4_2$, it should read $ax_1x^4_2$.
In [4] on page 32 on line 5 the bottom should read $-2$ instead of $+2$.
On the same page (page 32 in [4]), diagrams $X_9$ and $J_{10}$ are incorrect.
The correct diagrams are $X_9=T_{2,4,4}$ and $J_{10}=T_{2,3,6}$ and are found on
the next page (page 33 of [4]).
