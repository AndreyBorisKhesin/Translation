Catastrophe theory first appeared in Western print about ten years ago.
Magazines such as ``News Week'' reported the revolution in mathematics as
comparable to the invention of Newton's Calculus.
It was claimed that this new science--catastrophe theory--was much more
useful to humanity than mathematical analysis: while Newton's theories allowed
for the study of smooth, continuous processes, catastrophe theory provided a
universal method of study for all abrupt transitions, gaps, and sudden
noticeable changes.
Hundreds of scientific and near-scientific publications appeared.
They applied catastrophe theory to wildly different objects, for example, the
beating of a heart, geometric and physical optics, embryology, linguistics,
experimental psychology, economics, hydrodynamics, geology, and the theory of
elementary particles.
Among published works about catastrophe theory there are studies about the
effect of alcohol on drivers of various modes of transportation, the sturdiness
of ships, prisoner rebellions, the behaviour of stock market players, modeling
brain activity and mental disorders, and the politics of censorship pertaining
to erotic literature.

In the early 1970's, catastrophe theory quickly became a fashionable, widely
advertised theory.
Its universal pretenses reminded of the pseudo-scientific theories of the
previous century.

Pocket editions of the mathematical papers of the founder of catastrophe theory,
the French mathematician R. Tom, were republished and widely circulated.
This had not happened in the mathematical world since the appearance of
cybernetics, which, like catastrophe theory, mostly advertised itself.

After the admirers of catastrophe theory came more sobering, critical papers.
Some of these were printed in publications intended for the layman, bearing
eloquent titles such as ``But he isn't wearing anything at all!''.
Today there are reviews of papers that are critical of catastrophe
theory.\footnote{Couckenheimer, J. \textit{The catastrophe controversy}--``The
Mathematical Intelligencer'', 1978, v. 1, \textnumero1, p. 15-21.}
Today there no unanimity about the value of catastrophe theory.
Below is the personal opinion of the author of the paper.\\

\textbf{\centerline{H. Whitney's Singularity Theory}}

In 1955, American mathematician Hassler Whitney published his paper ``Mappings
of the plane into the plane''\footnote{Whitney H. Mappings of the plane into the
plane--``Ann. Math.'', 1955, v. 62, p. 374-470.}.
It laid the foundation of a new mathematical theory--singularity theory for
smooth mappings.

To truly understand catastrophe theory, one must first be introduced to elements
of Whitney's singularity theory.
Singularity theory is a grandiose generalization of the study of maxima and
minima of functions.
In Whitney's theory, functions are replaced with mappings, in the simplest case
--mappings of surfaces into the plane.

The mapping of a surface into the plane is a matching of every point on the
surface with a point on the plane.
If a point on the surface is defined by coordinates $(x_1,x_2)$ on the surface
and a point on the plane is defined by coordinates $(y_1,y_2)$, the mapping is
defined by a pair of functions:
$$y_1=f_1(x_1,x_2),\quad y_2=f_2(x_1,x_2).$$
Mappings of smooth surfaces into the plane are all around us.
In fact, most bodies that surround us are bounded by smooth surfaces.
Visible outlines of bodies are just projections of the surfaces surrounding
those bodies onto the eye's retina.
If we were to take a closer look at the bodies that surround us, for example,
the faces of people, we can study the singularities of the visible outlines.

Whitney noticed that in cases of ``general position'', there are only two types
of singularities.
All more complicated singularities are destroyed at the slightest movement of
the bodies or the direction of projection while singularities of these two types
are stable and are preserved despite small deformations in the mapping.

An example of a singularity of the first type (Whitney named it a fold) is the
singularity of a mapping of the projection of a sphere into the plane at point
on its equator (Fig. 1 (Projection of the surface of a sphere into a horizontal
surface.
A singularity arises on the equator of the sphere, which is called a fold.)).
In local coordinates this singularity is defined by these formulas:
$$y_1=x_1^2,\quad y_2=x_2$$
Unsurprisingly, projecting surfaces of smooth bodies on an eye's retina results
in such a singularity in the common points.
What is surprising is that other from this singularity, the fold, we regularly
encounter exactly one other singularity, but almost never notice it.

Whitney named this second singularity ``the assembly''.
It results from projecting surfaces shown in Fig. 2 (The projection of the
surface $y_1=x_1^3+x_1x_2$ into the horizontal plane.
There is a singularity called Whitney's assembly at 0.
Three inverses of point $p$, $u$, $v$, and $w$, are shown.) into the plane.
This surface is defined by the formula $y_1=x_1^3+x_1x_2$ in a space with
coordinates $(x_1,x_2,y_1)$ and is projected into the horizontal plane
$(y_1,y_2)$.

This way, the mapping is defined in local coordinates by the formulas:
$$y_1=x_1^3+x_1x_2,\quad y_2=x_2.$$

On the horizontal plane of projection forms a half-cubic parabola with a return
point (the peak) in the initial coordinates.
This curve separates the horizontal plane into two distinct parts.
Points in the smaller part each have three inverses (three points in the surface
map to this point).
Points in the larger part each have one.
Upon approaching the curve from the smaller part of the projection, two inverses
merge and disappear (this point contains a singularity, a fold); upon
approaching the peak, all three inverses merge.

Whitney proved that the assembly is stable, so any similar mapping has a
similar singularity in a corresponding similar point (such a singularity, so
that a deformed mapping in corresponding coordinates, near the indicated point
is defined by the same formulas as the original mapping near the original point).
Whitney also proved that any singularity of a smooth mapping of a surface into
the plane, if disturbed, will promptly ``collapse'' into fold and assemblies.

In this manner, visible contours of smooth bodies in general position contain
return points in places where the projections contain assemblies and do not
contain other singularities: if we look closely, we can find these return points
in the outlines of every face and body.
Let us examine, for example, the surface of a smooth torus (let us say, an
inflated tire).
A torus is normally drawn as depicted in Fig. 3 (A standard depiction of a
torus.).
If the torus were transparent, we would see its outline, as depicted in Fig. 4
(Singularities of the projection of a torus into a plane: 4 assembly points are
visible.): the corresponding mapping of a torus into a plane contains 4 assembly
points.
In this manner, the ends of the lines of the visible outline in Fig. 3 are the
return points.
In these points the line of the visible outline contains a half-cubic singularity.

Transparent tori are hard to come by.
Let us examine another transparent body, a bottle.
Fig. 5 (Bottleneck.
Two assembly points are visible.) depicts a bottleneck; two assembly points are
visible.
By rocking the bottle, we can convince ourselves that the assemblies are stable.
Thus we obtain convincing experimental confirmation of Whitney's theorem.

After Whitney's pioneering work, singularity theory developed further.
Today, it is one of the central areas of mathematics, where several paths
intersect, linking the most abstract areas of mathematics (differential and
algebraic geometry and topology, group theory, generating mappings,
commutative algebra, complex space theory and so on) with the most applied areas
(theory of motion stability of dynamical systems, theory of bifurcation of
positions of equilibrium, geometric and wave optics and so on).\\

\textbf{\centerline{Applications of Whitney's Theory}}

Since smooth mappings are found ubiquitously, their singularities must be found
everywhere as well.
But since Whitney's theory provides a lot of information about singularities of
mappings in general position, we can try to use this information to study a
larger number of phenomena and processes in all areas of natural history.
This simple idea is the entire essence of catastrophe theory.

In the case where the mapping that is being examined is well-known enough, we
are talking about more or less directly applying the mathematical theory of
singularities to various natural phenomena.
Such an application actually leads to useful results, for example, in elasticity
theory and geometric optics (singularity theory of caustics and wave fronts,
which we will talk more about later).

However, in most works about catastrophe theory, we are usually talking about a
much more debatable situation, when not only is the mapping that is being
studied unknown, its own existence is rather problematic.

Applications of singularity theory in these situations are characteristic of
speculations.
To provide an idea of such mappings, we will recreate the English mathematician
C. Zeeman's example of speculative application of Whitney's theory to the study
of activities of a creative character\footnote{Zeeman E. C., Catastrophe theory;
a reply to Thom.--In: Dynamical Systems Warwick, 1974, Lecture Notes in
Mathematic 468. Berlin--Heidelberg--New York, 1975. p. 373.}.

We will characterize the creative character (for example, of a scientist) with
three parameters, called ``skill'', ``interest'', and ``achievements''.
Apparently, there must be a correlation between these parameters.
Thus appears a surface in three dimensional space with coordinates $(S,I,A)$.

Let us project this surface onto the plane $(S,I)$ alone the $A$ axis.
For a surface in general position, the singularities are folds and assemblies
(according to Whitney's theory).
We claim that an assembly, positioned as shown on Fig. 6 (A diagram of change of
achievements [$A$] of an artistic character depending on skill [$S$] and
interest [$I$].
With enough interest, increase in skill leads to a significant jump from
``maniac'' to ``genius'', but an increase in interest that is not supported by
an increase in skill leads to the ``genius--maniac'' catastrophe.)
satisfactorily depicts the observed phenomena.

In fact, let us observe how in these suggestions, the achievements of the
scientist will change based on his skill and interest.
If interest is low, then achievements monotonously and fairly slowly rise with
skill.
If interest is sufficiently high, then qualitatively new phenomena occur.
In this case, achievements can rise with a jump as skill increases (such a jump
will happen if, for example, skill and interest change along curve 1 on Fig. 6
at point 2).
The area of high achievements, which we finish in in this situation, is labeled
``genii''.

On the other hand, an increase in interest that is not supported with a
corresponding increase in skill, leads to a catastrophe (on curve 3 at point 4,
Fig. 6), where achievements fall with a jump and we finish in the area labeled
``maniacs''.
It is instructive that jumps from the state of ``genius'' to the state of
``maniac'' and back happen on different curves.
Thus, at a sufficiently high interest level, a genius and a maniac may have
equal levels of skill and interest, but different achievements (and histories).

The problems with the described model and the set of speculations analogous to
it in catastrophe theory are too obvious to describe in detail.\\

\textbf{\centerline{Catastrophe Engine}}

Unlike the example described above, the application of singularity theory to the
study of the bifurcations of points of balance is perfectly justified.

In many rigid constructions, there are several points of balance in presence of
the same external forces.
Let us examine, for instance, a horizontal ruler whose ends are fixed, that is
weighted down by a weight placed on the midpoint of the ruler.

Along with the point of equilibrium where the ruler is bent downwards by the weight,
another point is possible where is ruler is bent up like a bridge.

As the weight is increased, there comes a point when a ``catastrophe'' or a
``clap'' occurs: the ruler moves from one state to the other.
Singularity theory is applicable to the study of such claps and its predictions
are perfectly supported by experiment.

For a visual illustration of applications of this type, there exist a large
number of inventions.
One of the simplest ones is called Zeeman's catastrophe engine and is depicted
on Fig. 7.
(Zeeman's catastrophe engine.
$A$--board; $B$--cardboard disc; $C$--needle that the disc can revolve around;
$D$--needle inserted only into the disc; $E$--needle inserted only into the
board; $F$ and $G$--elastic bands; $H$--pencil; $I$--sheet of paper;
$K$--catastrophe curve.
As pencil $H$ moves, disc $B$ makes jumps when pencil $H$ crosses the
catastrophe curve $K$.)

Everyone can easily make their own catastrophe engine.
For this, one needs a board (on Fig. 7--$A$) and, having cut out a cardboard
disc ($B$), insert a needle into the disc's centre ($C$) and into the board so
that the disc can rotate about its axis.
Another needle ($D$) is inserted only into the edge of the disc, and a third
($E$) only into the board.
To complete the assembly of the engine, one only needs two rubber bands ($F$,
$G$), a pencil ($H$), and a sheet of paper ($I$).

After the needle at the edge of the disc has been attached to the motionless
needle and to the pencil with elastic bands, the tip of the pencil is placed at
some point on the sheet of paper, thus stretching the elastic bands.
The disc is affixed in a certain position.
Now, upon moving the tip of the pencil, the disc will rotate.
It turns out, at a certain position of the tip of the pencil, a small change in
said position is capable of producing a ``catastrophe'' i. e. the disc will jump
to a new position.
If we marked the poisiton of all of these ``catastrophes'' on the paper, we will
get the ``catastrophe curve'' ($K$).
