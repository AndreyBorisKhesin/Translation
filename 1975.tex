\maketitle
On October 23--24, 1974, the third and final round of the All-Union olympiad
``The Student and progress of science and technology''.
This was the first All-Union student olympiad; it was on several different
disciplines, among them, mathematics.

The third round of the subject olympiad in mathematics was held at the
Mechanico-Mathematical Department at MSU.
To hold the competition, a jury chaired by P.S. Alexandrov was created from the
faculty of the Department.
Many professors and graduate students proposed problems and graded the
solutions.
The final selection of problems was done by the authors of this article.

There were 18 teams at the olympiad; there were two teams from the RSFSR, one
team from each of the other republics, and one team from each of Moscow and
Leningrad.
In total, 89 students participated in the olympiad.
Note that all of the proposed problems were solved by the olympiad's
participants.
Here is a list of the top 10 participants:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
S.V. Konjagin (Moscow, MSU, Mech.-Math., 2\nd year),
\item
A.B. Alexandrov (Leningrad, LSU, Math.-Mech., 4\th year),
\item
V.V. Sologubov (RSFSR-2, MPTI, 2\nd year),
\item
A.N. Drobotenko (Moldova, Kishinev Polytech. Inst., 3\rd year),
\item

\end{enumerate}

In the team standing, Moscow and Leningrad shared first and second place, with
Ukraine coming in third.

Below we present the problems of the third round of the All-Union mathematical
olympiad, as well as their solutions.
In total there were 11 problems: five on the first day and six on the second.\\

\centerline{\textbf{Day 1}}

\textbf{1.}\quad\textit{Prove that functions $f_1,\dots,f_n$ are linearly
independent if and only if there exists a set of points $t_1,\dots,t_n$, such
that $\det||f_i(t_j)||_{i,j=1}^n\neq0$.}

\textit{Solution.}
If $\det||f_i(t_j)||_{i,j=1}^n\neq0$, then it is clear that $f_i(t)$ are
linearly independent.
Let us prove the converse by induction.
For $n=1$ it is evident.
Suppose that the statement is true for $n=k$ and prove the statement for
$n=k+1$.
Let us find $k$ points $t_1,\dots,t_k$ such that
$\det||f_i(t_j)||_{i,j=1}^k\neq0$.
Suppose that there is no $k+1$\th point with the required property.
This means that
$$\det
\begin{array}{||ccc||}
f_1(t_1)&\dots&f_{k+1}(t_1)\\
\dotfill&\dotfill&\dotfill\\
f_1(t_k)&\dots&f_{k+1}(t_k)\\
f_1(t)&\dots&f_{k+1}(t)
\end{array}
\equiv0.$$

Expanding the determinant along the last row we get
$$f_1(t)C_1+\dots+f_{k+1}(t)C_{k+1}\equiv0,$$
where
$$C_{k+1}=\det||f_i(t_j)||_{i,j=1}^k\neq0,$$
by inductive hypothesis.
We have arrived at a contradiction with the problem's assumption of linear
independence.
Thus, the problem statement is true for $n=k+1$.

This problem was fully solved by 25 people.
12 people did not attempt it.
The rest gave incomplete or incorrect solutions.\\

\textbf{2.}\quad\textit{The function f(t) is defined over $[0,+\infty)$ and has a
continuous derivative.\\\indent
a) It is known that $f(t)+f'(t)\to A$ as $t\to+\infty$.
Prove that $f(t)\to A$ as $t\to+\infty$.\\\indent
b) It is known that $f(t)-f'(t)\to A$ as $t\to+\infty$.
Is it true that $f(t)\to A$ as $t\to+\infty$?}

\textit{Solution.}
a) Subtracting a constant, we can simplify the problem to $A=0$.
Suppose that $f(t)+f'(t)=g(t)$.
Then
$$\hspace{10ex}f(t)=Ce^{-t}+e^{-t}\int\limits_0^te^\tau g(\tau)
\text d\tau=Ce^{-t}+e^{-t}\left[\int\limits_0^Te^\tau g(\tau)
\text d\tau+\int\limits_0^te^\tau g(\tau)\text d\tau\right].$$

\quad Thus
$$|f(t)|\leq|C|e^{-t}+e^{-t+T}\max\limits_{t\geq0}|g(t)+
\max\limits_{t\geq T}|g(t)|,$$
from which the problem statement (a) follows.

b) It is not true that $f(t)\to A$.
Indeed, if $f(t)=e^t$, then $f(t)-f'(t)=0$, but $e^t$ does not approach 0 as
$t\to+\infty$.

This problem was fully solved by 19 people.
45 people managed to solve part (b), while 11 people did not attempt the
problem.\\

\textbf{3.}\quad\textit{The function $f(x)$ is defined over $[0,+\infty)$,
has a continuous derivative, and satisfies
$\displaystyle\int\limits_0^{+\infty}|f'(x)|\text{\normalfont d}x<+\infty$.
Prove that the series $\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty f(n)$ converges if
and only if the integral
$\displaystyle\int\limits_0^\infty f(x)\text{\normalfont d}x$ converges.}

\textit{Solution.}
The Newton-Liebnitz formula and the mean-value theorem imply
that for $0\leq\theta\leq1$, one has
$$\left|\int\limits_n^{n+\theta}f(x)\text dx-\theta f(n)\right|
\leq\theta\int\limits_n^{n+1}|f'(x)|\text dx.$$

Therefore for $0<u<v$,
$$\hspace{10ex}\left|\int\limits_u^vf(x)\text dx-\sum\limits_{n=[u]+1}^{[v]-1}
f(n)-\theta_1f([u])-\theta_2f([v])\right|\leq\hspace{30ex}$$
$$\hspace{30ex}\leq\int\limits_{[u]}^{[v]+1}|f'(x)|\text dx,\quad0\leq\theta_j
\leq1\quad(j=1,2).$$
Whence the required statement is obtained by applying the Cauchy criterion.

This problem was solved by 14 participants.
31 participants did not even attempt the problem.\\

\textbf{4.}\quad\textit{Evaluate $\displaystyle\int\limits_1^{10}x^x\text dx$
with a relative error of no more than 1\% }(\textit{it is necessary to give the
answer, not to prove the accuracy of the answer; $\ln10\approx2.3026$}).

\textit{Answer.}
$\displaystyle\int\limits_1^{10}x^x\text dx\approx\frac{10^{10}}{1+\ln10}\approx
0.30\cdot10^{10}.$

Here is the reasoning:
$$\int\limits_1^{10}x^x\text dx=\int\limits_1^8x^x\text dx+\int\limits_8^{10}x^x
\text dx=A+B;\quad A<\int\limits_1^88^x\text dx<\frac{8^8}{\ln8}<10^7;$$
$$B=\int\limits_8^{10}x^x\text dx=\int\limits_8^{10}\frac{\text d(e^{x\ln x})}
{1+\ln x}=\frac{x^x}{1+\ln x}\bigg\rvert_8^{10}+\int\limits_8^{10}
\frac{x^x\text dx}{(1+\ln x)^2x}\approx\hspace{10ex}$$
$$\hspace{10ex}\approx\frac{10^{10}}{1+\ln10}+\frac{x^x}{(1+\ln x)^3x}
\bigg\rvert_8^{10}\approx\frac{10^{10}}{1+\ln10}\approx0.30\cdot10^{10}$$
(the computation above ignores values giving an error of under 1\%).

Only two participants solved this problem: A.B. Alexandrov (Leningrad) and P.E.
Normak (Estonia).
50 people did not attempt to solve this problem.\\

\textbf{5.}\quad\textit{Let coordinate axes be chosen in the three-dimensional
space and let $V_1$ be a convex polyhedron, all of whose vertices lie on the
integer lattice points.
Let $V_k$ denote the polyhedron, whose radius vectors are obtained from $V_1$ by
multiplying all of the radius vectors of all of the vertices of $V_1$ by $k$.
Let $N(V)$ denote the set of integer lattice points that lie inside of polyhedron
$V$ or on its surface and let $\mu(V)$ denote the volume of polyhedron $V$.
Prove that}
\begin{equation}
N(V_3)-3N(V_2)+3N(V_1)-1=6\mu(V_1).
\end{equation}

The solution will be carried out by induction over the dimension.
On a line the following formula is true:
\begin{equation}
N(V_1)-1=l(V_1),
\end{equation}
where $l(V_1)$ is the length of the line segment $V_1$, whose endpoints have
integer coordinates.
Let us show that on a plane for a convex polygon $V_1$ with vertices in the
integer points, the following formula holds:
\begin{equation}
N(V_2)-2N(V_1)+1=2S(V_1),
\end{equation}
where $S(V_1)$ is the area of $V_1$.
From equation (2) it follows that (3) holds for degenerate two-dimensional
polygons, namely, line segments.
From here it is immediate that if polygon $V_1$ were cut by a diagonal
into two pieces $V_1'$ and $V_1''$, then
$$N(V_2)-2N(V_1)+1=[N(V_2')-2N(V_1')+1]+[N(V_2'')-2N(V_1'')+1].$$
Thus one only needs to prove (3) for triangles.\\

[Figure 1]\\

Let us put the origin $O$ at a vertex of the integer triangle $V_1$ (Fig.~1) and
let $A$ and $B$ be the triangle's two other vertices.
Let $OA'B'$ be the triangle $V_2$.
From Fig.~1 it is clear that the left hand side of equation (3) is equal to
$N(\Pi)$, the number of integer points in the shape $\Pi$, which is the
parallelogram $OACB$ without sides $AC$ and $BC$.
If $S(\Pi)$ is the area of parallelogram $OACB$ (equal to $2S(V_1)$) then to
prove (3) it remains to verify that $N(\Pi)=S(\Pi)$.
Note that shifting $\Pi$ to integer points we can tessellate the entire plane
(without intersections).
Moreover, a square with a side of length $M$ intersects with
$\displaystyle\frac{M^2}{S(\Pi)}+O(M)$ $\Pi$-parallelograms.
The number of integer points in these parallelograms is equal to
$\displaystyle N(\Pi)\frac{M}{S(\Pi)}+O(M)$.
However the number of integer points in the square under consideration is equal
to $M^2+O(M)$.
Thus, $N(\Pi)=S(\Pi)$, which proves formula (3).\\

[Figure 2]\\

Now consider the three-dimensional case.
From (3) it follows that it is sufficient to prove equation (1) for tetrahedra,
where the proof is analogous to the two-dimensional case but is based on a more
complicated drawing (Fig.~2).
From the polyhedron $V_3=OA'B'C'$ we exclude three polyhedra of type $V_2$,
located ``at the corners'' $A'$, $B'$, $C'$, but we add their pairwise
intersections (of type $V_1$) and exclude one extra point $P$.
The remainder is a parallelepiped $\Pi$ with a volume of $6\mu(V_1)$ without a
part of the surface.
These parallelepipeds can tessellate all space without intersections.
Thus $N(\Pi)=\mu(\Pi)$, which proves the desired statement.

This problem was solved only by E.P. Turkevich (Ukraine).
Several participants were on the right track.
67 people did not attempt it.\\

\centerline{\textbf{Day 2}}

\textbf{1.}\quad\textit{Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function over $[0,1]$ and let
$\phi(x)$ be a continuous periodic function over $(-\infty,+\infty)$ with a
period $T$.
Prove that}
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\to+\infty}\int\limits_0^1f(x)\phi(nx)\text dx=
\frac1T\int\limits_0^T\phi(t)\text dt\cdot\int\limits_0^1f(x)\text dx.
\end{equation}

\textit{Solution.}
Let $\chi_{[\alpha,\beta]}(x)$ be a function equal to 1 for
$x\in[\alpha,\beta]$ and 0 for $x\notin[\alpha,\beta]$.
Let us prove equation (4) for $f(x)=\chi_{[\alpha,\beta]}(x)$, where
$[\alpha,\beta]\subset[0,1]$.
We get
$$\int\limits_0^1\chi_{[\alpha,\beta]}(x)\phi(nx)\text dx=
\int\limits_\alpha^\beta\phi(nx)\text dx=
\frac1n\int\limits_{\alpha n}^{\beta n}\phi(x)\text dx\to
(\beta-\alpha)\frac1T\int\limits_0^T\phi(x)\text dx$$
as $n\to+\infty$.

To prove (4) in the general case we need to uniformly approximate $f(x)$ by
piecewise constant functions.

This problem was solved by 17 people.
25 people did not attempt it.\\

\textbf{2.}\quad\textit{What is the largest number of normals that one can draw
to an ellipse from a point outside of it?
Describe and draw the set of points outside of the ellipse with the maximum
number of normals.}

\textit{Solution.}
Write the equation for an ellipse in polar coordinates
$x=a\cos t$, $y=b\sin t$.
A normal passing through the point $(a\cos t,b\sin t)$ on the ellipse has the
equation $ax\sin t-by\cos t=(a^2-b^2)\sin t\cdot\cos t$.

The envelope of this family of normals can be defined parametrically by
combining this equation with the relation acquired by differentiating this
equation in $t$:
$$ax\cos t+by\sin t=(a^2-b^2)\cos 2t.$$

Excluding the parameter $t$, we arrive at the equation for an astroid:
$$(ax)^{2/3}+(by)^{2/3}=(a^2-b^2)^{2/3}.$$

Note that the transition from one number of normals to another can only
happen on this astroid.
From here it is easy to verify that one can draw 4 normals to the ellipse from
any point that lies inside the astroid; there are 2 normals from any point
outside of the astroid as well as from its vertices, while there are 3 normals
on the astroid itself (except for the vertices).

If $a^2>2b^2$, then the astroid goes outside of the boundaries of the ellipse
(Fig.~3).
In Fig.~3, the shaded area gives the answer to the problem.\\

[Figure 3]\\

This problem was fully solved only by S.E. Belkin (Moscow).
39 students did not attempt the problem.\\

\textbf{3.}\quad\textit{Given are two trigonometric polynomials $p(t)$ and
$q(t)$, prove that there exists a polynomial $R(x,y)$ such that
$R(p(t),q(t))\equiv0$.}

\textit{Solution.}
Let $p(t)$ and $q(t)$ be algebraic polynomials of $e^{it}$ and $e^{-it}$
of a degree no greater than $m$.
Let $R(x,y)$ be an algebraic polynomial of degree $N$ in two variables.

Then $R(p(t),q(t))$ is a trigonometric polynomial, which is of $e^{it}$ and an
algebraic polynomial $e^{-it}$ of a degree no greater than $mN$.
If we were to take the polynomial $R(x,y)$ with undefined coefficients and in
the expression for $R(p(t),q(t))$ set the coefficients of $e^{ikt}$ to zero,
then we would get $2mN+1$ linear homogeneous equations on
$\displaystyle\frac12(N+1)(N+2)$ coefficients of the polynomial $R$.
It follows that for a large $N$ the number of unknowns will be outgrow the
number of equations, from which the existence of a desired polynomial $R$
follows.

This problem was solved by 11 people.
51 people did not attempt to solve it.\\

\textbf{4.}\quad\textit{Consider a sequence of balls whose radii tend to 0, but
whose total volume is infinite.
Prove that it is possible to fit a finite number of these balls inside a cube so
they would fill 99\% of the cube's volume.}

\textit{Solution.}
It is sufficient to prove the following statement: there exists a number
$\alpha$, $0<\alpha<1$, such that for any ``vessel'' $G$ (a region with a
piecewise-smooth boundary) it is possible to insert a finite number of balls of
the given sequence into the vessel so that they should fill a volume no
less than $\alpha\mu(G)$, where $\mu(G)$ is the volume of vessel $G$.
In fact, if this is true, then we can place spheres into the initial cube in
such a way that there will remain an empty space of volume $(1-\alpha)\mu_0$
($\mu_0$ is the volume of the initial cube).
Regarding the remaining unfilled space as a new vessel, we once again
fill an $\alpha$\th part of it and so on.
After $n$ steps, the unfilled volume will be $(1-\alpha)^n\mu_0\to0$ as
$n\to+\infty$.

Since any vessel can be filled with cubes with an arbitrarily small error, we
see that it suffices to learn how to fill an $\alpha$\th part of any cube.
Here is one of the possible algorithms for such a filling.
Suppose we want to full a cube with a side of length 2 with spheres.
Take a cube with side length 1 and whose centre in the centre of the
initial cube.
Sort the balls in the order of decreasing radius and let their radii be
$r_1\geq r_2\geq\dots$.
Choose a number $N$ such that $r_N<1/2$ and start to place the
consecutive balls $N,N+1,\dots$ by positioning their centres inside of the unit
cube.
The process will inevitably terminate on some $M$\th step as the total volume of
all of the balls is infinite.
Suppose that we managed to fit the balls of radii $r_N,r_{N+1},\dots,r_{N+M}$.
Let us show that the same centres and doubled radii cover the unit cube in its
entirety\dots
Indeed, if we could find a point in the unit cube that did not get covered by
the balls with doubled radii then that means that the distance from this point
to any ball is $\geq r_{N+M}$, which means we could have fit one more ball with
its centre at that point and with radius $r_{N+M+1}\leq r_{N+M}$.
All constructed spheres obviously lie within the cube with side length 2.
This means that if $V$ is the total volume of the balls we embedded then $8V>1$
and so $V>1/8$, which comprises $1/64$ of the volume of the cube with side
length 2.

Three people solved this problem: S.E. Belkin (Moscow), S.V. Konjagin (Moscow),
and V.V. Sologubov (RSFSR-2).
60 people did not attempt the problem.\\

\textbf{5.}\quad\textit{A vertex of a curve is a point that is an where the
curvature has an extremum.
Prove that any smooth (infinitely differentiable) closed convex curve contains
at least four vertices.}

\textit{Solution.}
If $(x_1(s),x_2(s))$ is the equation for a curve with an arc-length parameter
($s$), then, as is well-known,
$$\ddot x_1(s)=-k(s)\dot x_2(s),\quad\ddot x_2(s)=k(s)\dot x_1(s).$$
It follows that for any numbers $a_0$, $a_1$, and $a_2$
\begin{equation}
\int\limits_\Gamma(a_0+a_1x_1+a_2x_2)\frac{\text dk}{\text ds}\text ds=
a_0\int\limits_\Gamma\text dk-a_1\int\limits_\Gamma\ddot x_2\text ds+
a_2\int\limits_\Gamma\ddot x_1\text ds=0.
\end{equation}
The curvature $k(s)$ has a maximum and minimum on $\Gamma$.
If they were the only vertices then by drawing the straight line
$a_0+a_1x_1+a_2x_2=0$ through them we would arrive at a contradiction with
equation (5), since $(a_0+a_1x_1+a_2x_2)\frac{\text dk}{\text ds}$ does not
change sign in this case.

This same problem also allows the following simple geometric solution (suggested
by S.M. Gusein-Zade).
Let us inscribe a circle $S$ of maximum radius $r$ into curve $\Gamma$ (Fig.~4).
Let $A$ and $B$ be the points of tangency of the curve $\Gamma$ and the circle
$S$ so that there are no other tangency points on the arc $AB$.
It is easy to see that $\cup AB\leq\pi$.
Additionally, the curvature of $\Gamma$ at points $A$ and $B$ is no larger than
$r^{-1}$ and strictly less than $r^{-1}$ at some points near $A$ and
$B$.
Let us shift the arc $AB$ on curve $S$ orthogonally to the line segment
$AB$ in the direction of its curvature by the maximum possible distance so that it
still intersects the curve $\Gamma$ (at point $C$).
In this case $C$ is the point of tangency of the arc and the curve $\Gamma$ and the
curvature of $\Gamma$ at the point $C$ is no less than $r^{-1}$.
Now, the existence of at least two local curvature maxima of curvature immediately
follows, and hence so does the existence of two minima.

Only one person managed to solve this problem: A.N. Drobotenko (Moldavia), while
68 people did not attempt it.\\

\textbf{6.}\quad\textit{Does there exist a complex polyhedron with 6 vertices
and 15 edges in four-dimensional space?}

\textit{Solution.}
Such a polyhedron exists.
It is sufficient to take any two triangles in planes $(x,y,0,0)$ and
$(0,0,z,u)$ containing the origin and then consider their convex hull.
As an example let us take the points
$$A_1=(1,0,0,0),\quad A_2=(-1,1,0,0),\quad A_3=(-1,-1,0,0),$$
$$A_4=(0,0,1,0),\quad A_5=(0,0,-1,1),\quad A_6=(0,0,-1,-1).$$

For a proof that these are the points we were looking for it suffices for
any pair of points $A_i$ and $A_j$ to find a linear function
$\alpha x+\beta y+\gamma z+\delta u$, which assumes larger values at the
points $A_i$ and $A_j$ than at any others.
Obviously, it is sufficient to examine just the pairs $A_i$ and $A_j$ with
$i\leq3,j>3$.
The required linear forms are easy to find.
For example, $-x+y+2z$ for $A_2$ and $A_4$; $-x+y-z+u$ for $A_2$ and
$A_5$; $-x+y-z-u$ for $A_2$ and $A_6$.

This problem was only solved by A.B. Alexandrov (Leningrad) and 59 people did
not attempt it.

\textit{Remark.}
The last problem reflects a rather particular case of an interesting phenomenon:
\textit{in four-dimensional space for any $n$ it is possible to find such a
convex polyhedron with $n$ vertices that from any vertex one can
``see'' any other vertex, that is line segments connecting any two vertices
are edges of this polyhedron.}
As an example of such a polyhedron, one can take, for example, the convex
envelope of any $n$ distinct points that lie on the curve
\begin{equation}
x(t)=(t,t^2,t^3,t^4),\quad-\infty<t<+\infty.
\end{equation}

This curve has the following remarkable property: if $x_1=x(t_1)$ and
$x_2=x(t_2)$ are two distinct points then there exists such a three-dimensional
hyperplane passing through them so that all the other points lie strictly on
one side of it.
Indeed, let us draw the hyperplane of type $l(x)=c$ ($l$ is a linear form)
through points $x_1$ and $x_2$, and parallel to the tangent vectors to the curve
at both points (it is easy to verify that a vector parallel to the chord
$x_1x_2$ and these tangent vectors are linearly independent).
Then $l(x(t))-c$ is a polynomial of degree 4 with two multiple roots, $t_1$
and $t_2$, and therefore $l(x(t))-c$ preserves its sign.
